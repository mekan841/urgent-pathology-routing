Code to accompany the paper titled

Effective Resource Management using Machine Learning in Medicine: An Applied Example

## There are two input datasets: 

Dataset one: from an earlier time period. Contains more information re. trip times and distances than the second dataset, but is incomplete.
It is used for time and distance modeling and model validation. The expected schema is given in preprocess_datasets.py 

Dataset two: from a later time period. Contains less information re. trip times and distances than the first dataset, but is complete.
It is used for simulation and analysis. The expected schema is given in preprocess_datasets.py

This repository provides an example of the application described in the paper. Due to location-specific code, it will require adaption to a new location and other specific requirements.
